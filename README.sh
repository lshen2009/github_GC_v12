Code.GC12: the currently working directory
Code.GC12_Nov4: Delete the last species and see if I can make the code run. But it does not work.
Code.GC12_Nov7: Add LSHENA in the Standard.eqn and then delete it using KPP. Now the code works,
                but not in an elegant way.
Code.GC12_Nov8: Now the code works well based on Code.GC12_Nov7.
Code.GC12_Nov9: The number of Functions that needs editting is reduced to 8. I test after deleting 6 species.
