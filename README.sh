Code.GC12: the currently working directory
Code.GC12_Nov4: Delete the last species and see if I can make the code run. But it does not work.
Code.GC12_Nov7: Add LSHENA in the Standard.eqn and then delete it using KPP. Now the code works,
                but not in an elegant way.
Code.GC12_Nov8: Now the code works well based on Code.GC12_Nov7, but in an elegant way.
Code.GC12_Nov9: The number of Functions that needs editting is reduced to 5. I test after deleting 6 species.
Code.GC12_Nov10: I test two mechanisms, one for whole chem in the troposphere and the other for nonVoCs in the Statosphere. Now the simulation time can reduce 20%.
Code.GC12_Nov12: I defined var_selected and var_deleted in the Global variable. Now the simulation time can reduce 20%.
Code.GC12_Nov13: Now the gckpp_Integrator can adapt to varying dimensions of fast and slow species.
